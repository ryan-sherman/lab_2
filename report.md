1.  I read the 4 criteria

2.  It is important to choose a license in order for your software to be used correctly.  Without a license, the default is all rights reserved, which is likely to be undesirable.  Choosing the right license means knowing your software will be used and distributed the way you intend.

3.  Without an explicit license, accessing a project in any way could lead to litigation, as without license the default is all rights reserved, regardless of what the developers might imply.

4.  It seems Gopher lost reputation in the hacker community by taking a step away from the open source model.  The article's suggestion that this had a cascading effect on Gopher's development, leading to forking problems, dead ends, and lack of community support seems probable.  It is important to keep the right reputation when working with software your intend to be open source.

5.  Android has a very large developer base in part due to its use of the permissive Apache License 2.0.  The requirements the license does impose make sense for its use as a multiplatform commercial operating system.  Google is able to maintain control of its trademarks, and requires that developers document modifications and can keep copyrights, which gives some degree of security and lets developers reliably work for a profit.

6.  We choose Apache!

7.  The GPL license can be regarded as generally the best for the common good as it enforces free redistribution of software carrying it, requires documentation of any modifications and disclosure of the source, as well as notice of the GPL nature of the software.  LGPL is good for developers who need to reference libraries for any purpose, and who may want to maintain free access to libraries they write.  As Google's Android system demonstrates, Apache can be very good for companies as it prevents re-use of trademarks, thus reserving certain rights that allow profitability and patents while gaining many of the benefits of open source software (i.e. attracting developers).  BSD is extremely permissive, disclaiming all warrantees, only requiring the reproduction of the license and copyright.

8.  The class groups presented and had similar choices and explanations as what I've described in 7.
